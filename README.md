# flex-practic_1
In this project I worked with flex box

Step #1. Create a clone of the project
```sh
In Git CMD , specify the path to the folder where you want to clone the project.
Then enter the command :                                             
clone git https://github.com/rojinald/flex-practic_1.git
```
Step #2.Connect Prepros to the project
```sh
In Prepros, open the project, go to the folder .../#source/scss/style.scss
and on the right in the OUTPUT FILE column specify the path to .../css/style.css
```
Open the project in VS code, find the style.css file, it describes all the flexbox properties that I used.
